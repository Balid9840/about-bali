###Bali DeFreitas

######Professional Student and Depressed Potato Chip

If you came across this file, chances are it was by accident. You probably came across it to laugh me or make jokes, I wouldn't blame you. I'm pretty lame overall, but I mean enjoy the stay here. It's pretty empty in here anyway and I mean there's not much to know about me. I guess I could cover some bases on who I am and what I live for, well as you know I'm Bali DeFreitas. You can call me Deadbeat however, I grew up in Florida for about 4 years before my father passed away. I came to New York on my own instict of wanting to be around my mother, the first couple of years is a blur however. I started school at 6, only because Florida schools wouldn't allow me to go into any school of sort. When I was in the first grade a lot of kids bullied me because how different I was compared to them, I was a very hyper-active and happy-go lucky kid. (I mean if you know me well, you'd question where that all went right?) After getting bullied by students,teachers and even the princepal of all people, I was finally transferred. However it was a tad bit too late as I sprialed into a deep depression and started blocking the world out from reaching my emotions. The follow the last two years of Middle School, I been through a lot of stuff that I'd personally like to forget. The start of high school at HSTAT was a bit better than I expected, I begin opening up more and trying my best to make friends and eventually I befriended this awesome girl. She was almost a spliting image of whom I was, I eventually developed a crush on her. However over time, she was overcome by my depression and problems, which ultimately stopped our friendship. So I guess that covers everything you need to know as of now.
